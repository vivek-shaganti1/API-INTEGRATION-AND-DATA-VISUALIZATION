##using OpenWeatherMap API and Python project:

üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data Visualization Using Python & OpenWeatherMap API
This project demonstrates how to fetch real-time weather data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) using Python and create meaningful visualizations using data science libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The aim is to give users the ability to understand weather patterns such as temperature, humidity, and pressure trends for different cities through visual representation.
We begin by accessing the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides detailed and structured weather data for cities across the globe. Using the API key, Python makes HTTP requests to fetch current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather descriptions. The data returned is in JSON format, which is then parsed and processed using Python's requests and json libraries.
Once the data is collected, we store it in a structured format using Pandas DataFrames, making it easier to analyze and visualize. For the purpose of comparison and analysis, the project allows users to input multiple cities, enabling side-by-side examination of weather metrics.
To transform the raw weather data into informative visuals, we use Matplotlib and Seaborn. Matplotlib helps generate basic bar charts and line graphs, while Seaborn is used for advanced, aesthetically pleasing plots like heatmaps and category-based comparisons. These visualizations make it easy to identify patterns‚Äîfor example, which cities are currently experiencing the highest humidity or lowest temperatures.
Some of the key plots generated in this project include:
Bar chart of temperatures across selected cities.
Line graph showing pressure trends.
Heatmaps comparing humidity levels.
Pie chart summarizing weather conditions like "clear", "cloudy", and "rainy".
The combination of live API data and visualizations provides valuable insights at a glance. This can be useful for students, travelers, or anyone interested in meteorological data.
This project highlights the practical use of Python for data collection, transformation, and visualization. It also reinforces skills in using APIs, handling JSON responses, and turning data into charts and graphs that communicate information clearly and effectively. Moreover, it serves as a foundation for building more advanced dashboards or integrating weather data into larger applications.
Whether you're a beginner learning Python or someone diving into data visualization, this project is a great example of combining real-time data with analytical tools to build something informative and interactive.
